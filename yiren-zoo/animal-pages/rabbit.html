            <p>Rabbits are small mammals with fluffy, short tails, whiskers and distinctive long ears.
                There are more than 30 species around the world, living in many different environments. 
                Some rabbits are about the size of a cat, and some can grow to be as big as a small child. 
                Small rabbits, such as pygmy rabbits, can be as little as 8 inches (20 centimeters) in length and 
                weigh less than a pound. Larger species grow to 20 inches (50 cm) and more than 10 lbs. (4.5 kilograms).
