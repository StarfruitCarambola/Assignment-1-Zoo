    <div class="text">Grizzly bear is subspecies of the brown bear. These huge animals originate from Europe and Asia, 
      but today they can be found only in North America and Canada. They live in woodlands, forests and valleys near rivers.
      During 1970s number of grizzly bears dropped significantly because of the mass hunt. Since that time, hunting of bears is prevented by law, 
      and their number gradually increased in time. Today, grizzly bear is "threatened" species which means almost endangered.
