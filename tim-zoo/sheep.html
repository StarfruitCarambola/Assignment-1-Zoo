  <p>
    Sheep are domesticated, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic
    sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep
    are raised for fleeces, meat, and milk. A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested through shearing.
    The types of meat that a sheep can provide are lamb, hogget and mutton.
