    The name, Cow, actually is given to mature female cattle. Cows are one of the most common
    domestic farm animals around the world. Adult male cattle are referred to as bulls. Cows are most famous
    for their milk and meat products, as well as leather for clothing and other products. Since only females
    can produce milk, female cattles also known as cows, are one of the most common animals in the dairy industry.
    Milk from cows is used to make a wide range of loved products such as butter, yogurt, cheese and ice cream.
