    The pig, often called swine, hog, or domestic pig, is an omnivorous, domesticated even-toed hoofed mammal.
    When they are kept as livestock, they are farmed primarily for the production of a meat called pork.
    There is little difference between wild pigs and domestic swine however, the tusklike teeth of domesticated
    pigs are not as developed as the tusks of their wild kin, who use the sharp ends to forage for roots and as a defensive
    weapon. Domestic pigs are categorized into three basic types: large-framed lard types, smaller bacon types and pork types.
    A 250 pound domesticated pig can provide around 154 pounds of meat.
