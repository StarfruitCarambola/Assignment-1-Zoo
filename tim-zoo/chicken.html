    The chicken is a domesticated bird, with attributes of wild species such as the red and grey junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia.
    The term for an adult male is a Rooster or cock and an adult female is called a hen. They were originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
    chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population
    of 23.7 billion as of 2018. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird and they are omnivores.
