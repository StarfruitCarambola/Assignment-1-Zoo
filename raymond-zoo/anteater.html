      Anteater, (suborder Vermilingua), any of four species of toothless, insect-eating mammals found in tropical savannas and forests 
      from southern Mexico to Paraguay and northern Argentina. They are long-tailed animals with elongated skulls and tubular muzzles. 
      The mouth opening of the muzzle is small, but the salivary glands are large and secrete sticky saliva onto a wormlike tongue, 
      which can be as long as 60 cm (24 inches) in the giant anteater. Anteaters live alone or in pairs (usually mother and offspring) 
      and feed mainly on ants and termites. They capture their prey by inserting their tongues into insect nests that they have torn open 
      with the long, sharp, curved claws of their front feet; the claws are also used for defense. Giant anteaters and the smaller tamanduas 
      use their hind legs and tail as a tripod when threatened, which thus frees the front limbs to slash at attackers.
